# Collectd

## Quick Start

```bash
# start collectd
docker run --privileged --net="host" -v "/:/mnt/root" -v /etc:/mnt/etc:ro -v /dev:/mnt/dev:ro -v /proc:/mnt/proc:ro --name collectd erwinnttdata/collectd:5.4.1-6_deb8u1_001
```

## Description

Collectd as a docker container. It have to run in privileged mode to access the
host `/proc` directory. The system directories from the host need to be
mounted for the container. Additional directories can be mounted to `/mnt`
for the `df` plugin.

## Volumes

* `/mnt/collectd`

## Build

The build and deployment can be started by using the included `Makefile` 
build file.

```bash
# Build the Docker image.
make build
# Deploy the Docker image.
make deploy DOCKER_HUB_USER=user DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD='password'
```

To test the build locally, the included `Makefile` also have the goals

* `test-collectd`
  Starts the build collectd image.

* `test-collectd-bash`
  Executes bash inside the container.

```bash
make test-collectd
# or,
make test-collectd-consul
# or,
make test-collectd-bash
```

It depends on an installed Graphite with Carbon instance and uses the write-graphite
plugin configured in `test-graphite/write_graphite.conf`. The host needs to be
updated to the real host in the configuration file.
